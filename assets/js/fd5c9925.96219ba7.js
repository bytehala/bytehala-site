When I added the CNAME, which is done through GitHub web, it tags the correct author. My other commits, which I did on my laptop, was a different author (still me).\\n\\n![Commit history with wrong user](./2_commit_history.png)\\n\\nSo I went and investigated what my local settings were:\\n\\n```bash\\ngit config --global user.name\\ngit config --global user.email\\ngit config user.name\\ngit config user.email\\n```\\n\\nIt was something else, somehow I set my iCloud email, and my first name as the `user.name`.\\n\\nGit history is basically just a bunch of files, I know it can be edited. Just be warned, it can sometimes make your repo irrecoverable, and even mangle your history. Try not to do this at your job without proper backups, especially since you\'ll have to force push.\\n\\n```bash\\ngit filter-branch -f --env-filter \'\\nGIT_COMMITTER_NAME=\\"@bytehala\\";\\nGIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL=\\"your-correct-email@example.com\\";\\nGIT_AUTHOR_NAME=\\"@bytehala\\";\\nGIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL=\\"your-correct-email@example.com\\";\\n\' --tag-name-filter cat -- --branches --tags\\n```\\n\\nYou\'ll see this `WARNING: git-filter-branch has a glut of gotchas generating mangled history rewrites.` I chose to ignore that. heh\\n\\nAfter force pushing, here\'s my new heatmap, showing I made 141 commits so far this 2025:\\n\\n![New heatmap with correct counts](./3_after_141_contribs.png)"},{"id":"android-studio-build-failing","metadata":{"permalink":"/dev/android-studio-build-failing","source":"@site/dev-articles/2025-04-24-android-studio-build-failing/index.mdx","title":"Android Studio Build Failing","description":"I\'m currently primarily working in React Native, and a lot of the time, I use the command line to launch the app, for Android it\'s react-native run-android","date":"2025-04-24T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Android","permalink":"/dev/tags/android","description":"Android"},{"inline":false,"label":"React Native","permalink":"/dev/tags/react-native","description":"React Native"}],"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Lem Dulfo","title":"Senior Software Developer @ Clio","url":"https://bytehala.com","page":{"permalink":"/dev/authors/bytehala"},"socials":{"github":"https://github.com/bytehala"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/bytehala.png","key":"bytehala"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"android-studio-build-failing","title":"Android Studio Build Failing","authors":["bytehala"],"tags":["android","reactnative"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Why Your Github Contributions Are Not Counted","permalink":"/dev/contributions-not-on-heatmap"}},"content":"I\'m currently primarily working in React Native, and a lot of the time, I use the command line to launch the app, for Android it\'s `react-native run-android`\\n\\nSometimes though, you need to launch the app through Android Studio. For example when you want an easy way to see Logcat logs.\\n\\nI ran into this issue where the app was building properly through the command line, but failing in Android Studio.\\n\\n![Android studio build failing](./1_build_fail.png)\\n\\nThis is odd, because behind the scenes, both the command line and Android Studio use the same tools.\\n\\nOne of the build errors mentioned `react-native-vector-icons`, and I found this issue on their Github: https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-svg/issues/1723\\n\\nIt mentions `react-native doctor` and JDK 17. The thing is, running this in command line, where the build is already succeeding, will most likely show that you have the correct version of JDK.\\n\\nCould it be that Android Studio was using a different JDK version? Let\'s check.\\n\\n![Android Studio Gradle JDK setting](./2_android_studio_setting.png)\\n\\nIt was using JDK 21 for some reason. I changed it to JDK 17 and the build succeeded.\\n\\n![Android Studio build successful](./3_build_success.png)\\n\\nSo there it is, here\'s some things I learned:\\n\\n- `react-native doctor` is available, I didn\'t know about it before\\n- Android Studio runs a different environment from your command line\\n- Error messages can sometimes mislead you, treat them as a clue instead of a fact"}]}}')}}]);
