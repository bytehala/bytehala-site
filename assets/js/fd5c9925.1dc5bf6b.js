For example when you want an easy way to see Logcat logs.\\n\\nI ran into this issue where the app was building properly through the command line, but failing in Android Studio.\\n\\n![Android studio build failing](./1_build_fail.png)\\n\\nThis is odd, because behind the scenes, both the command line and Android Studio use the same tools.\\n\\nOne of the build errors mentioned `react-native-vector-icons`, and I found this issue on their Github: https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-svg/issues/1723\\n\\nIt mentions `react-native doctor` and JDK 17. The thing is, running this in command line, where the build is already succeeding, will most likely show that you have the correct version of JDK.\\n\\nCould it be that Android Studio was using a different JDK version? Let\'s check.\\n\\n![Android Studio Gradle JDK setting](./2_android_studio_setting.png)\\n\\nIt was using JDK 21 for some reason. I changed it to JDK 17 and the build succeeded.\\n\\n![Android Studio build successful](./3_build_success.png)\\n\\nSo there it is, here\'s some things I learned:\\n\\n- `react-native doctor` is available, I didn\'t know about it before\\n- Android Studio runs a different environment from your command line\\n- Error messages can sometimes mislead you, treat them as a clue instead of a fact"}]}}')}}]);
