Everytime I have an idea for a feature or code, or a pattern, but I don't want to share my company's app screenshots, one of my hurdles is I don't want to start an app from scratch. I always wanted to have a boilerplate, one that has navigation, modals, and most features that Clio's mobile app has. Some non-work analog of what I work with on the daily.

I think ReactNative boilerplate solves a lot of that.
