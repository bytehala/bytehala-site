A cool demo I saw on Threads, showcasing this nice chunky rounded matte glass jelly effect.
I don't know how else to describe it. [Link](https://my.spline.design/glassmorphcursortracking-2ef6d3790000fd1a4f81c92fb3ff5bf5/)

I initially thought it was pure CSS. Turns out, it's a whole 3d "runtime".

```typescript
  import { Application } from 'https://unpkg.com/@splinetool/runtime@1.9.48/build/runtime.js';
  const canvas = document.getElementById('canvas3d');
  const app = new Application(canvas);
  // ...
```

Pretty cool. I love the chunky matte effect, it reminds me of sea glass.
