        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm currently primarily working in React Native, and a lot of the time, I use the command line to launch the app, for Android it's <code>react-native run-android</code></p>
<p>Sometimes though, you need to launch the app through Android Studio. For example when you want an easy way to see Logcat logs.</p>
<p>I ran into this issue where the app was building properly through the command line, but failing in Android Studio.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Android studio build failing" src="https://bytehala.com/assets/images/1_build_fail-532c77f14f63d2e09bd4619c31e30143.png" width="2264" height="1058" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>This is odd, because behind the scenes, both the command line and Android Studio use the same tools.</p>
<p>One of the build errors mentioned <code>react-native-vector-icons</code>, and I found this issue on their Github: <a href="https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-svg/issues/1723" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-svg/issues/1723</a></p>
<p>It mentions <code>react-native doctor</code> and JDK 17. The thing is, running this in command line, where the build is already succeeding, will most likely show that you have the correct version of JDK.</p>
<p>Could it be that Android Studio was using a different JDK version? Let's check.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Android Studio Gradle JDK setting" src="https://bytehala.com/assets/images/2_android_studio_setting-cccd90c2077c6aaaedec3e6e969aac7c.png" width="1966" height="1266" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>It was using JDK 21 for some reason. I changed it to JDK 17 and the build succeeded.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Android Studio build successful" src="https://bytehala.com/assets/images/3_build_success-7c09265d24f5d416dc6bf4a9f9ba9c0e.png" width="2442" height="1590" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>So there it is, here's some things I learned:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>react-native doctor</code> is available, I didn't know about it before</li>
<li>Android Studio runs a different environment from your command line</li>
<li>Error messages can sometimes mislead you, treat them as a clue instead of a fact</li>
</ul>]]></content>
